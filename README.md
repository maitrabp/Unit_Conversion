# Unit_Conversion
Here's my second mobile application using Android Studio. It's a unit conversion app. I've decided to include both weather conversion &amp; distance conversion. 
# Program Description
The app has two fragments which are replaced in realtime using the overflow menu provided on top right corner. As you open the app, you will find the temperature fragment on top as it has been set to default. The temperature fragment can convert temperatures from both F to C and vice versa. If the converted temperature if cold, the app changes it's theme color to blueish. On the other hand, if the temperature conversion is pretty hot, the app changes it's theme to red. Thus, the user is able to differentiate between cold and hot temperatures. However for distance, there is no such feature. Distance is very simple, you can convert from Miles to KM and vice versa, and the theme is defaulted to green. The data is retained when the user switches back and forth between the two fragments, or even closes the app (Saved State).
